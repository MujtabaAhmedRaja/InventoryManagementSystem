# InventoryManagementSystem
This Java-based project is a simple console application for managing inventory and processing orders. The system uses a HashMap to store product details, allowing for efficient product lookup, and a Queue to manage incoming orders in a first-in, first-out manner.
Features:

Product Management: Add, update, delete, and search for products in the inventory.

Order Processing: Add new orders to a queue and process them sequentially.

Stock Management: Automatically updates product quantities when an order is processed, with checks for insufficient stock.

Order Cancellation: Cancel pending orders.

This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand basic data structures like HashMap and Queue in a practical context
